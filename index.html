<!-- Description: This is the front-end of what user sees about our chrome extention.
 index.html is one of the four primary files needed for any Chrom extension to work. The four files are:-
 1. manifest.json: This file lists all the important information about how the Chrome extension would work and the permissions it needs.
 2. index.html: As said, this is the user-facing side of the extension.
 3. home.js: This is the JavaScript file used by our index to relay information to the backend JavaScript.
 4. background.js: This is also refered to as the "service worker". This file handles all the main functions performed by the extension.

                <h3><b>Ad and Tracker Blocking</b></h3>
                <p>Raaz will block most intrusive and annoying ads and trackers from websites. Some ads can be malicious and trackers can be used to collect data about your browsing behaviour.</p>
            
                <h3><b>Third-Party Cookie Blocking</b></h3>
                <p>Fret not Cookie Monster, These are not the cookies you eat! Much like trackers, cookies, especially third-party cookies, can be used to collect data about you and send you targeted ads.</p>
            
                <h3><b>Referer header Blocking</b></h3>
                <p>Referer headers tell the current website where you are coming from. This can be used to track your browsing behaviour or stealing your information.</p>
